# Olympics

## Ben Schwartz

This is a project from my high school years that showcases some object-oriented programming in C++. The project includes the following files:

- `Athlete.h` and `Athlete.cpp`: define and implement the `Athlete` class, which represents an Olympic athlete and includes attributes such as name, country, and event statistics
- `Competition.h` and `Competition.cpp`: define and implement the `Competition` class, which represents an Olympic event and includes a collection of `Athlete` objects, as well as methods for sorting and displaying the results
- `ScoreCard.h` and `ScoreCard.cpp`: define and implement the `ScoreCard` class, which represents the scores for an Olympic event and includes methods for calculating and updating the scores
- `FiendsAssnBoy.cpp`: the main program for the project, which creates and manages instances of `Athlete`, `Competition`, and `ScoreCard` objects, and provides a user interface for interacting with the program

Please note that this is a project from my high school years, and I may not be able to provide specific details about its functionality or implementation.
